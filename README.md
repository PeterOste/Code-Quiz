# CodeQuiz

## Description
This project tests JavaScript knowledge by presenting five multiple-choice questions and calculating the score based on two criteria; correct answers and how quickly they have been answered. The score and initials will be logged in to local memory when a user presses "Save score" at the end of the quiz. This is valuable because the quiz can be taken as many times as necessary, measuring against past attempts.
